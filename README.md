Getting Started- Unity & Hololens 1

Setting up developing environment as a complete novice isnt easy sometimes. I am writing this to my future self should i encounter similar trivial problems.
Documentations on official page is good but there are still things to watch out for. 
Official getting started can be found here :

Look for answers below IF:
Unity Build settings do not detect any Visual studio, Restart PC ( Note that Unity MUST install AFTER VS )

During build, Error : cannot find SDK of previous version, Open Visual Studio Installer -> Modify, add the version needed
